## ❓ How To Play
1. Choose a game mode
2. Start the game: Once you've chosen your game mode, start the game by clicking in the text box.
3. Begin typing: The game will display tongue twisters for you to type. Type the words as quickly and accurately as possible.
4. Watch your progress: The game will keep track of your words per minute (WPM), accuracy, and other stats. Keep an eye on these numbers to see how well you're doing.
5. Don't look at your keyboard: If you want to improve your typing skills, try not to look at your keyboard while you type. This will help you build muscle memory and type more quickly and accurately.
6. Keep practicing: The more you practice, the better you'll get. Try playing different difficulty with reduced timing to push yourself further.
7. Have fun: Remember, the goal of a speed typing game is to have fun while improving your typing skills. Don't get too caught up in the numbers and enjoy the game!

## 📌 Summary
Overall, this project has allowed me to be able to have a better understanding on how various methods and functions work together.
It gave me plenty of practice time to amend and troubleshoot various parts of the code during the development process.
My biggest challenge faced would definitely be checking when the words were typed correctly and display it after the player types the letters.
Another challenge i faced was connecting the stats to the right sections of the game.
I faced issue initially with the score/highscore not registering properly.
It was a fun project and feels fulfilling when things start to fall into place by the end of the development process.
Looking forward to working on more projects to improve my software developing skills further.
